#### Overview

In this chapter, we will be creating a Java serverless microservice using AWS Lambda. We will use the AWS Eclipse Toolkit to download a Java Lambda template that we will use as a starting point. We will use this as a starting point to develop our microservice. This microservice will eventually curate and automatically generate thumbnails for an S3 bucket. We will extend this microservice in the next chapter.
